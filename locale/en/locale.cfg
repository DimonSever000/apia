apia-briefing=Apia Briefing

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
apia-briefing=[planet=apia] is a moon planet orbiting [planet=gleba] with a dense atmosphere, where [entity=logistic-robot] and [entity=construction-robot] require significantly more energy. Due to thick cloud cover, [entity=solar-panel]s are inefficient.\nThe entire surface is covered by seas of [fluid=royal-jelly], inhabited by [entity=larvae]. The hardened remains of these creatures can be processed into basic resources: [item=iron-ore], [item=copper-ore], and [item=stone].\nOther inhabitants of the planet include honey-producing insects that build [entity=wild-hive]s. The [item=honeycombs] they produce can be processed into [item=honey] and [item=wax].\nA new and important resource on this planet is [item=phosphorus].
