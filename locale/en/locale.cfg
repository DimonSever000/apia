apia-briefing=[planet=apia] is one of the planets of the [planet=apia]-[planet=carnova] binary planetary system with a dense atmosphere, where [entity=logistic-robot] and [entity=construction-robot] require higher costs. Due to dense clouds, [entity=solar-panel] is less effective.\nThe entire surface is covered by seas of [fluid=royal-jelly], inhabited by [entity=larvae]. The hardened remains of these creatures can become a source of basic resources: [item=iron-ore], [item=copper-ore], and [item=stone].\nOther inhabitants of the planet are honey-bearing insects that build [entity=wild-hive]. The [item=honeycombs] they produce can be processed into [item=honey] and [item=wax].\nA new important resource of the planet is [item=phosphorus] and [fluid=phosphoric-acid].
carnova-briefing=[planet=carnova] is one of the planets of the [planet=apia]-[planet=carnova] binary planetary system. The surface is covered by oceans of [fluid=blood], where spawning grounds of the local fauna—[entity=piranha]—are often found.\nThe main source of basic resources is [item=bones], consisting of minerals and calcium. From them, basic resources can be obtained: [item=iron-ore], [item=copper-ore], [item=stone], [item=phosphorus], and [item=calcite].\nThe surface consists of numerous islands of [item=flesh], which can be processed to obtain [item=proteins] and [item=lipids]. An alternative industrial acid source will be [fluid=phosphoric-acid].
